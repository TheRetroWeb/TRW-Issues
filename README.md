# The Retro Web - Issue tracker
**Bogus issue tracker for The Retro Web**

To avoid making the entire website repository public, I've made this empty project to track website-related issues with something that isn't a Google Doc.

Note that "Done" comments are referring to development branches, you will see closed issues updated only when a milestone is applied to the production server.
